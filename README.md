#🕹️ OOP & Reinforcement Learning in Pokémon Red


##📜 Overview
This project is a fork of PWhiddy's Pokémon Red Experiments, aiming to enhance the structure by adopting an object-oriented programming (OOP) approach. Currently, this repo only implements a portion of that goal, focusing on extracting the Rewards system into its own object. 🎯

##🔑 Key Changes

##🏗️ Class Structure
Created RewardManager and EmulatorManager classes.
Abstracted update_reward() from red_gym_env_v2.py to promote modularity and cleaner code structure. 📐
